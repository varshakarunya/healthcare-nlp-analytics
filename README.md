# Healthcare NLP Analytics – Patient Feedback Insights

## Overview
This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze healthcare-related patient feedback and service complaints. The goal is to identify common service issues and operational patterns that can support data-driven decision-making in large healthcare organizations.

This project is inspired by real-world healthcare analytics use cases and uses publicly available, de-identified text data.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory analysis on healthcare-related text data
- Clean and preprocess unstructured text
- Engineer NLP features using TF-IDF
- Build classification models to identify service issue categories
- Generate actionable operational insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- NLP (NLTK / scikit-learn)
- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression / Naive Bayes
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Project Structure

## Data
Publicly available healthcare-related feedback and complaint text datasets (de-identified).

## Status
Project setup complete. Exploratory text analysis in progress.
